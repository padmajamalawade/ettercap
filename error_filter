ettercap filtering doesn't work

You can also load a script  without enabling it by appending :0 to the filename

And from the code:

/* enable a loaded filter script? */
uint8_t f_enabled = 0;
/* is there a :0 or :1 appended to the filename? */
if ( (opt_end-optarg >=2) && *(opt_end-2) == ':' ) {
        *(opt_end-2) = '\0';
        f_enabled = !( *(opt_end-1) == '0' );
}

Error 2:
For those who are installing ettercap in ubuntu 12.04, most of us get the error while make of:

make[2]: *** [ettercap] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/Programs/ettercap/src'
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/Programs/ettercap/src'
make: *** [all-recursive] Error 1

To fix this:

cd src
gedit Makefile

change 'LIBS = ' to match 'EC_LIBS =

Error 3:
Edit Ettercap password sniffer engine?

Just add "usuario" to "[USER]" and "clave" to "[PASS]" in the etter.fields file. On my system it is located at /usr/share/ettercap/etter.fields.
